# Zlib-for-Casio-FX-CG50
LINE RASTERIZER FOR PYTHON WITH CASIO FX-CG50 CALCULATORS.

Adds line functionality to the Casio FX-CG50's python. Might work with other Casio calculators that run python, just needs the Casioplot library.

IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS, BUT FOR ANYONE INTERESTED, USES BRESSENHAM'S ALGORITHM

HOW TO USE: use the "from zlib import *" command in a python file on your calculator.
SYNTAX: Currently, only line(x1,y1,x2,y2) and vline(x1,y1,y2).
